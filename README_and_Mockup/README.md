- BACKGROUND

Visualizes data around COVID, tracking increases and falls in key elements. I especially would like to track vaccine adverse event reporting to indicate a lack of adverse event in contrary to certain bipartisan narratives. If there is enough interesting data, I would ideally like to make the entire visualizer and page using the VAERS sub database of the CDC's WONDER database. VAERS reports on vaccine events and is a self-reporting system so it tracks a lot of interesting data. The VAERS database is updated monthly by the CDC.


- FUNCTIONALITY & MVPs

In COVID_Data_Visualizer, users will be able to:

1) Access continuously updated data on vaccine adverse events and other relevant topics via the CDC WONDER API
2) Interact with graphs, charts other data visuals with a variety of :hover and :active events.
3) See a variety of stylized representations of data.
4) Interact with a flat, minimalist design page.

In addition, this project will include:

1) An About modal describing where the data was soutrced from, instruction for use of the visualizer, and maybe even a small about the author section.
2) A production README.
3) Light mode/Dark mode toggle button?

- WIREFRAME(S)

See README_and_Mockups folder.

- TECHNOLOGIES, LIBRARIES, APIs

1) D3.js
2) Charts.js
3) CDC WONDER API
4) Three.js
5) Pts.js
5) Anime.js

- IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE

1) Friday Afternoon - D3.js tutorials, troubleshooting API usage, and searching CDC WONDER for interesting data that I want to visualize.

2) Weekend - Start on making flagship graph, look for data for a secondary and tertiary graph. Continue learning about D3. Research how to make a modal. If permitted to use Anime.js, look into how to animate subsections. Research flat, minimalist design.

3) Monday - Polish flagship graph, further knowledge of D3, try to make flagship graph look good. Start on left-div hover sub-visualizer - based on datasets see what kind of info I would want to show up.

4) Tuesday - Polish LinkedIn a little bit (this is part of my project because I want the footer to actual lead people to information about me. GET A REAL LINKEDIN PICTURE.)

5) Wednesday -
